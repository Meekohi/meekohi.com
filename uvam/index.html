  <p>The Moché were an ancient people who thrived in the arid southern valleys of Peru’s North Coast between AD 100–800. Numerous depictions of warfare portrayed in murals and ceramic designs suggest the consistent presence of con ict in their culture. In such a complex, stratied society obviously concerned with military aggression, it is not surprising that warriors comprised a signi cant class in Moché society.</p>
  <p>Vessels such as this stirrup-spout bottle, so called for the similarities between the spout shape and the stirrup of a saddle, were a common form among Moché potters. For this particular vessel type, a mold system was used in conjunction with modeled elements to increase the rate of production while allowing for a high degree of standardization.</p>
  <p>In this instance, a kneeling warrior presents himself holding a mace and a square shield. The  gure’s head is adorned with an elaborate headdress featuring a snarling puma ef gy with mouth open and claws outstretched. The feline motif likely indicates membership in a specific group or clan known for sharing the attributes of the puma: strength, ferocity, and stealth. Atop the puma efgy is a crescent-shaped  nial closely resembling a tumi, or ceremonial knife. In addition, the warrior is clad in an embellished tunic, and also wears large, round ear  ares, each bearing the face of a deity.</p>

      <em>Seated Shakyamuni, the Historical Buddha, 15th c. Tibet</em><br/>
      Gilt bronze, 7 3/16 x 5 1/2 x 4 in, 18.2 x 13.97 x 10.16 cm<br/>
      Gift of Walter Hauser, 2006.22<br/>

  <p>The Buddha is shown reaching down with his right hand, a gesture known as “calling the Earth to witness,” indicating his enlightenment at Bodh Gaya. He wears a patchwork robe and holds a begging bowl in his left hand, symbols of the austere lives of the buddha and his followers. A vajra (thunderbolt) rests before him, an ancient symbol from India originally associated with Indra, the king of the Hindu gods, and indicating spiritual strength and power.</p>
  <p>The gure shows some of the lakshanas, or signs, of buddhahood, including the urna (an auspicious mole on the forehead), the ushnisha (a cranial protrusion on the top of the head indicating supreme intelligence), and elongated earlobes that resulted from Shakyamuni renouncing his princely life and removing his jewelry, which would have included large gold disc plugs that had stretched his lobes. The head is painted with gold paint (known as “cold gold”) and the hair painted with indigo blue. Both pigments were applied ritually to such images in worship.</p>
